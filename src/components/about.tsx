                        My technical experience spans Python, Java, JavaScript, React, FastAPI, and PyTorch. I've built EZrad, a HIPAA-compliant medical imaging platform with real-time DICOM protocol integration for healthcare clinics, and TRACE, an enterprise security platform that integrates 5+ penetration testing tools with AI-powered password generation achieving 85% success rates. I'm certified as an Amazon Junior Software Developer and currently pursuing my IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate.
